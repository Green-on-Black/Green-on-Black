Hi there! My name is Connor. I’m an airline pilot, and although flying wasn’t exactly what I went to school for, it turns out it’s a pretty good gig.

By trade, I’m an analyst. I went to school to crunch numbers, formulate ideas, and build things. From July 2010 until May 2017, I bounced between analyzing problems, designing solutions, overseeing the development of those solutions (and doing some hands-on development myself), all the way through to implemention. The process was endless.

Said another way, it kind of looked like this:

```python
project_number = 1
work_status = "Done"

while True:
    if work_status == "Done":
        print(f"✅ Me: Project #{project_number} is complete! Can I go on vacation now?")
        
        new_buzzword = random.choice(BUZZWORDS).title()
        
        print(f"➡️ Stakeholder: Outstanding! And of course! Just be back by tomorrow to help us draw up the plans for Project #{project_number + 1}.")
        
        project_number += 1
        work_status = "Not Done"
    
    else:
        print(f"💻 Project {project_number} is Not Done yet...")
        work_status = "Done"
```

Eventually, my outlook on the job changed, and although I never had the goal of flying professionally for a living, I realized it may actually make for a nice career.

So I quit my day job.

Fast-forward to today and those same analytical skills that I used on Wall Street are skills that stuck with me. They were always fun to use to break down data and tell a story, and as it turns out, I can apply them just the same to things in my every day life.

Scattered across GitHub, you may find my contributions to projects pertaining to the airline industry, house-hunting, and other random projects. I won't always get them right, and virtually all of them will forever be "In Progress," but nonetheless, I hope you enjoy.
